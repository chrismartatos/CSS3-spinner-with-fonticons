/**  
	There is many ways to fadeOut the preloader/spinner with Javascript when the window is fully loaded.
	I prefer to use simple css and classes with a nice transition effect. (light & fast)
	However here is a very simple way to do it really quick:
**/	

/*$(function()
{
	//when window is fully load
	$(window).load(function()
	{
		$(".site-preloader").fadeOut('slow',function()
		{
			//Do something after the prelader is fadeout for example animate #page or add a class, or whatever.
		});
	});
});*/
